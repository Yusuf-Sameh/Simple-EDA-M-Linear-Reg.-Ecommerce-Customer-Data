# Overview
The source of this data is the Kaggle website, which is data that expresses e-commerce customers. It includes columns with personal data such as name, email, address, and other columns that describe the time each customer spends on the website or mobile application. This project is in an attempt to exploratory data analysis and build a multiple linear regression model to show the linear equation that links the response variable, which is the yearly payment, to the explanatory variables to get an idea of the most effective way to browse products, is it the web or the mobile application?
